# Duke

Duke is a basic task management application written in Java 11. It is a desktop application, but with a
Command Line Interface (CLI) only at this current stage. Although it is optimized for those who can type
fast and used to type commands, everyone is welcomed to use this application.

You can record and retrieve three kinds of tasks on this program - ToDo Tasks, Events and Deadlines. Each
time you modify the task list, it will be saved onto your hard disk so you will be able to see your list
after you close and open again this application.

You can refer to the github page with a more detailed explanation on the usage:
